tf-idf, short for term frequency-inverse document frequency, is a numerical statistic that reflects how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. The term frequency tf(t,d) is the raw count of a term in a document, i.e. the number of times that term t occurs in document d. The inverse document frequency means whether the term is common or rare across all documents it is obtained by dividing the total number of documents by the number of documents containing the term.
